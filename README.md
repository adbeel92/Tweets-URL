You can register any Tweets by an URL

Eg.: https://twitter.com/adbeedu/status/216631015253344256

First, you must create the database (/db/dbTweets.sql)
Then, update the file Persistence.php (/persistence/Persistence.php) adding user, password and the database name.

Finally, in your browser, write: 
	
	http://localhost/TweetUrlApp/

obs: The CURL should be instantiated.
